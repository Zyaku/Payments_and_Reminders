- Finish first draft Front-end:
    - Finish Basic CSS
    - Implement Action listeners
    - Redux / State mangment (Logged In / Logged Out)
        - When Logged in:
            - Sign Up not an option 
            - Log in -> log out 
            - Profile Section with possible Username / Password / Email Change
            - Payments Section according to user
        When Logged out:
            - One more Page ? (Ideas : Random embedded video for practice)
    Bugs:
        - Why does SignUp have LogIn css when not specified / empty ?

- remake / server CRUD API to match frontend:
    - should include user data ( unique e-mail/ unique Username / password )
        - Hashing ? 
        - Sorting ?
    - connect server to client

- AWS/Mongo DB implementation ?
